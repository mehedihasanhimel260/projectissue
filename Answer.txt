This issue commonly arises when using shared hosting. It often occurs if the maximum execution time is set below 300 seconds. If you are on a shared hosting plan, consider increasing the max execution time to 300 seconds. Making this adjustment typically resolves the problem.

It is advisable to open a single ticket for each project. Opening multiple tickets can lead to confusion, as some issues may be resolved while others remain pending. This makes it challenging for developers to accurately track and address the problems, especially when issues are interrelated. To ensure clarity and efficiency, I kindly request that you continue using a single ticket for the project. Thank you for your understanding.



Your server might be blocking outgoing HTTP/HTTPS traffic, or the destination URL is blocked.
If you're using shared hosting, outbound requests are sometimes restricted by the host.
Some cloud/VPS setups require you to explicitly allow outbound traffic via a firewall (e.g., iptables, ufw, AWS security groups).
Fix: Ask your hosting provider to whitelist outbound access to the verification server or check your VPS firewall settings.


It’s possible that some custom-time installed files were removed from the bootstrap/cache directory, which may be causing the current issue. If that’s the case, please follow the steps below to reinstall properly:

🛠 Installation Steps:
Step 1:
Visit the installation setup page:
👉 http://your-sitename/setup-product

Step 2:
Complete the license verification, environment, and database setup.

The issue occurred because "the bootstrap/cache folder was updated or the hosting was changed", which requires domain verification. Please follow the steps below to verify your domain:

Access your File Manager and locate the .env file in your project root.

Open the .env file and note the following credentials:

DB_DATABASE – copy this value

DB_USERNAME – copy this value

DB_PASSWORD – copy this value

Use these credentials during the setup process at:
http://Your-Domain/setup-product


If this seems difficult for you, please share the hosting access with us — we’ll take care of it for you.

Our script needs outbound HTTP (port 80) and (port 443)  for license verification, but it seems blocked on the server.
Please enable outbound  (port 80) and (port 443) so the system can verify the license and work properly.


Your server can’t open an outbound connection to port 443 (HTTPS)
So basically — outbound HTTPS (port 443) is blocked by shared hosting firewall.
That’s why your cURL call can’t verify the license 

make this domain whitelist for verify
