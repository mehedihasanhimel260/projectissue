### **Step 1: Prepare the Files**

1. Log in to the **source cPanel** (where your project is currently hosted).
2. Open **File Manager**.
3. Navigate to your project directory (usually in `public_html` or a subdirectory).
4. Select all the project files.
5. Click **Compress** and choose `.zip`.
6. Download the zipped file to your computer.

### **Step 2: Export the Database**

1. In the **source cPanel**, open **phpMyAdmin**.
2. Select the database your Laravel project is using.
3. Click the **Export** tab.
4. Choose **Quick Export** and format **SQL**.
5. Download the `.sql` file.

### **Step 3: Upload to the New cPanel**

1. Log in to the **destination cPanel** (new hosting).
2. Open **File Manager**.
3. Upload the zipped file to the desired location (e.g., `public_html`).
4. Extract the `.zip` file.

### **Step 4: Import the Database**

1. In the new cPanel, go to **MySQL Databases**.
2. Create a **new database**.
3. Create a **new database user** and assign it to the database with **All Privileges**.
4. Open **phpMyAdmin** on the new cPanel.
5. Select the newly created database.
6. Go to the **Import** tab.
7. Upload and import the `.sql` file you exported earlier.

### **Step 5: Update Laravel Configuration**

1. In File Manager, open your Laravel project folder.

2. Find the `.env` file.

3. Update the database settings with your **new database name, username, and password**. Example:

   ```
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=new_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=new_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=new_password
   ```

### **Step 6: Test the Site**

The issue occurred because the bootstrap/cache folder was updated or the hosting was changed, which requires domain verification. Please follow the steps below to verify your domain:

Access your File Manager and locate the .env file in your project root.

Open the .env file and note the following credentials:

DB_DATABASE – copy this value

DB_USERNAME – copy this value

DB_PASSWORD – copy this value

Use these credentials during the setup process at:
http://Your-Domain/setup-product

### **Step 7: Test the Site**

1. Visit your domain on the new hosting.
2. Check if everything is working properly (database connection, assets, routes, etc.).

👉 That’s it! Your Laravel project should now be fully moved to the new cPanel.
